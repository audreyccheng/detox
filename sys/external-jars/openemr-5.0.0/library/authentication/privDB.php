<?php
/**
 * To support an optional higher level of security, queries that access password
 * related information use these functions instead of the standard functions
 * provided by sql.inc.
 * 
 * By default, the privQuery and privStatement calls pass-through to
 * the existing ADODB instance initialized by sql.inc.
 * 
 * If an additional configuration file is created (secure_sqlconf.php) and saved
 * in the sites/<sitename> directory (e.g. sites/default).  The MySQL login
 * information defined in that file as $secure_* will be used to create an ADODB
 * instance specifically for querying privileged information.
 * 
 * By configuring a server in this way, the default MySQL user can be denied access
 * to sensitive tables (currently only "users_secure" would qualify).  Thus
 * the likelyhood of unintended modification can be reduced (e.g. through SQL Injection).
 * 
 * Details on how to set this up are included in Documentation/privileged_db/priv_db_HOWTO
 * 
 * The trade off for this additional security is extra complexity in configuration and
 * maintenance of the database, hence it is not enabled at install time and must be
 * done manually.
