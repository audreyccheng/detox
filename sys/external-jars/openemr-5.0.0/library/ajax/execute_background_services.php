<?php
/**
 * Manage background operations that should be executed at intervals.
 *
 * This script may be executed by a suitable Ajax request, by a cron job, or both.
 *
 * When called from cron, optinal args are [site] [service] [force]
 * @param site to specify a specific site, 'default' used if omitted
 * @param service to specify a specific service, 'all' used if omitted
 * @param force '1' to ignore specified wait interval, '0' to honor wait interval
 *
 * The same parameters can be accessed via Ajax using the $_POST variables
 * 'site', 'background_service', and 'background_force', respectively.
 *
 * For both calling methods, this script guarantees that each active
 * background service function: (1) will not be called again before it has completed,
 * and (2) will not be called any more frequently than at the specified interval
 * (unless the force execution flag is used).  A service function that is already running 
 * will not be called a second time even if the force execution flag is used.
 *
 * Notes for the default background behavior:
 * 1. If the Ajax method is used, services will only be checked while
 * Ajax requests are being received, which is currently only when users are
 * logged in. 
 * 2. All services are checked and called sequentially in the order specified
 * by the sort_order field in the background_services table. Service calls that are "slow" 
 * should be given a higher sort_order value.
 * 3. The actual interval between two calls to a given background service may be
 * as long as the time to complete that service plus the interval between
 * n+1 calls to this script where n is the number of other services preceding it
 * in the array, even if the specified minimum interval is shorter, so plan
 * accordingly. Example: with a 5 min cron interval, the 4th service on the list
 * may not be started again for up to 20 minutes after it has completed if 
 * services 1, 2, and 3 take more than 15, 10, and 5 minutes to complete,
 * respectively.
