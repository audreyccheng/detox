DEPENDENCIES

phpUnit runs on PHP3 or PHP4.

phpUnit uses PCRE (Perl Compatible Regular Expressions).  PCRE is
normally compiled into PHP, but it might be missing from custom builds
of PHP.


INSTALLATION

Place the phpunit.php file so that it is in the PHP include_path for
the PHP code to be tested.  Installing it in the same directory as the
code-under-test should work.

The same phpunit.php file can be shared by any number of test suites.
You may wish to install phpunit.php in just one place and adjust the
PHP include_path to include that place.


EXAMPLES

The self-test suite for phpUnit itself is currently the best (only)
example distributed with phpUnit.  See phpunit_test.php.
