INSTALL:
	
	Please refer to the docs/MANUAL or the "Manual" / API Guide link at http://phpgacl.sourceforge.net/

UPGRADING:
	
	MAKE A BACKUP FIRST! 
	MAKE A BACKUP FIRST! 
	MAKE A BACKUP FIRST! 
	Then run setup.php. It will most likely NOT work, as ADODB's XML Schema still needs some work. 

	Upgrading from ANY version to v3.3.x WILL NOT WORK YET! The schema format has changed way
	to much.
	
	Unless your running PostgreSQL, then upgrading from 3.1.x or older to 3.2.x or newer will require
	a complete dump (including column names), dropping the database, running setup.php, then 
	importing the dump. 
	
SYNOPSIS:

	require_once("gacl.class.php");

									'db_host' => 'localhost',
									'db_user' => 'root',
									'db_password' => '',
									'db_name' => 'gacl',
								);

	$gacl = new gacl($gacl_options);
