Installation
========================================================================

PLEASE ALSO READ THE DOCUMENTATION AVAILABLE ONLINE AT

	http://www.postcalendar.tv/wiki


To install PostCalendar simply unzip/untar the distribution inside your 
PostNuke html directory. This will create the ./modules/PostCalendar 
directory and should contain all the files of the distribution.

***NOTE: You'll need to CHMOD 777 the following directories:

	./modules/PostCalendar/pntemplates/compiled
	./modules/PostCalendar/pntemplates/cache

This allows Smarty to compile and cache your templates. If you're 
on a windows platform, just make sure the directory has read/write 
permissions for the web server.

If you would like to change the path of these directories, you can 
change the value of $this->compile_dir and $this->cache_dir in the 
pcSmarty.class.php file to point to wherever you'd like templates to be 
compiled. Moving this out of the webroot might not be that bad of an 
idea. (I have not tested this as of yet)

Now, enter the administration portion of your PostNuke site:

    * Select MODULES Administration
    * Click on the REGENERATE link
    * Find the PostCalendar entry in the list
    * Click INITIALISE
    * After the list reloads, click ACTIVATE

You should now have a fully functioning PostCalendar installation.

You'll want to enter your site's Administration and configure 
PostCalendar before you start to enter events. The installation 
will set defaults for the calendar so that it works, but in 
order to better suit your needs, it's best to change these as 
early as possible.

========================================================================
Upgrading
========================================================================
To upgrade PostCalendar you should first make a backup of you current
Database tables (using a tool like phpMyAdmin) and also backup your
current PostCalendar installation.  This will be useful in the event
an upgrade does not work for you.

Next, unzip/untar the PostCalendar distribution inside your Postnuke
html directory.  This will create the modules/PostCalendar directory
and place all the necessary files there.

***NOTE: You'll need to CHMOD 777 the following directories:

	./modules/PostCalendar/pntemplates/compiled
	./modules/PostCalendar/pntemplates/cache

This allows Smarty to compile and cache your templates. If you're 
on a windows platform, just make sure the directory has read/write 
permissions for the web server.

If you would like to change the path of these directories, you can 
change the value of $this->compile_dir and $this->cache_dir in the 
pcSmarty.class.php file to point to wherever you'd like templates to be 
compiled. Moving this out of the webroot might not be that bad of an 
idea. (I have not tested this as of yet)

***NOTE: DO NOT USE THE POSTNUKE MODULE ADMIN INTERFACE
         TO UPGRADE POSTCALENDAR.  DOING SO WILL BREAK
		 THE UPGRADE PROCESS. FOLLOW THE STEPS BELOW

Enter the administration portion of your PostNuke site:

    * Select POSTCALENDAR Administration
    * Click on the Upgrade PostCalendar Link

If all went well, you should see a CONGRATULATIONS message.
If not, you should see an ERROR message.

You should see link that says 'Upgrade PostCalendar 3.0x'

You should now have a fully functioning PostCalendar installation.

You'll want to configure PostCalendar before you start to enter events. 
The installation will set defaults for the calendar so that it works, 
but in order to better suit your needs, it's best to change these as 
early as possible.  You should also check your old events and edit
them if necessary.  Events that have no end date should have the 
appropriate repeating option for 'no end date' selected as this will
greatly speed up your calendar.

========================================================================
Menu Configuration
========================================================================
You can link to PostCalendar by entering {PostCalendar} in a menu block.

Using [PostCalendar] will also work, but this is for old style modules. 
Using the method above will produce much better results.

Goto your Block administration and edit/create the Menu block to hold 
your link to PostCalendar.

The Menu Block editing screen should look something like this:
 
+--------------+----------------+-------------+--------+--------+-------+ 
| Title        | URL            | Description | Delete | Insert | Blank |
+--------------+----------------+-------------+--------+--------+-------+ 
| PostCalendar | {PostCalendar} | My Calendar |        |        |       |
+--------------+----------------+-------------+--------+--------+-------+
