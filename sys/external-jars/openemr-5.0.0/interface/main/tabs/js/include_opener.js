/**
 * This is code needed to connect the iframe for a dialog back to the window which makes the call.
 * It is neccessary to include this script at the "top" of any php file that is used as a dialog.
 * It was not possible to inject this code at "document ready" because sometimes the opened dialog
 * has a redirect or a close before the document ever becomes ready.
