/**
 *
 *  Script to fax something to someone somewhere.
 *  This is currently set up for an in house secure email-fax gateway.
 *  This will need to be modified to use a HylaFax server if that is what you use.
 *
 *  We will need these as variables then:
 *		From, To, Object(s) to send
 *		These values are already in the openEMR DB, we just have to put them together correctly.
 *
 *  The first use case scenario is to fax the report of today's visit to a PCP/Referring doctor.
 *	The second scenario is the creation (or re-creation) of a Report of the encounter.
 *  To lighten loads, consider breaking these tasks up into separate tasks via cron or even using a different server
 *  to process these tasks, if in a multi-server environment.  Or run this file with openEMR's "background_services".
 *	Use a new table (form_taskman) to delineate this process.
 *  	1.  Create the Task to be performed: send it to DB table from the browser.
 *		2.  Cron job to scour this table, performing tasks as loads allow (check server load? <-- not implemented)
 *      3.  If the Object is ready to be created, create it. (e-signed required? <-- not implemented)
 *		4.  If the Object is created and it is a Report, Flag DB done (completed =1).
 *		5.  If the Object is created and it is a Fax, send it, and Flag DB done.
 *
